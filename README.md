# Python Timepass

These are the list of programs/applications I built on for either learning concepts using Python (AI etc)

This the part which is to be not seen by other Programmers , it has rough implementations , no documented code etc.

If you are looking for quality code or projects , look elsewhere cause this is not it.

or just plain to learn how to build projects/applications using Python.

These projects are not exhaustive , I will add any and all projects which were done in Practice for the future as well.
